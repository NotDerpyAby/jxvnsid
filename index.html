<h2 align="center"><i><u> First Quarter Reflection</u></i></h2>
I have learned lots of things this Quarter about Coding. Honestly I've also gotten better at coding compared to last year. I think thats due to the constant practice I've had to undergo this quarter, which I greatly appreciate. Overall this Quarter's mostly been about improving myself, not only in TLE but other also. But I consider this subject to be one of my more drastic improvements in comparison with past self. 
<br> <br>
	
Even if it has been somewhat stressful to code under a time limit, it allows me hone in my skills and truely focus on the necessary tasks or things that need to be accomplished in the given time limit. Even if I never completed the task in time... Regardless of that fact, atleast I was able to present something even if it wasnt complete. 
<br><br> 

So to summarize, I had a hard time adjusting to the whole coding under a time limit thing, but I appreciate the set of challenges it presented and what it taught me. Thanks to it,I've improved greatly in comparison to previous years in coding. Which I very much so appreciate. Honestly I was a bit reprehensive when I heard about the Hands-On Coding, but Ive learned to appreciate it and due to that I've learned more about TLE this 1st Quarter than I did previously.
